## 1)Data
All the csv files extracted from the videos and used for the analysis.
1.	Verified: 1 file per experiment (N=10 individuals). File contained detection threshold, moving average, low-pass filter, data cleaning steps.
2.	Classified: extraction of the behavioural response of mosquito larvae during the aversive stimulus (i.e., 3 seconds x 11 trials per experiment).
3.  Familiarisation: data from the familiarisation phase (i.e. the last 5 min before the start of the training phase).
4.  Supplementary: data and analyses for the correlations in supplementary material (size * ITI and Size * Trial_Response).

## 2)Analysis
